  "name": "Sage",
  "type": "townsfolk",
  "ability": "If the Demon kills you, you learn that it is 1 of 2 players.",
  "detailed_description": "The Sage knows nothing while alive, but learns the most important information of all at the moment of their death - who killed them. The Sage only gets this information when killed by a Demon attack. Being executed does not count. If the Sage was killed by the Demon, the storyteller will wake the Sage and tell them two players, one who is the Demon that killed the Sage.",
  "player_tips": [
    "Get killed by the Demon. Do it. By any means, and as quickly as possible. If the Demon kills you, you get fantastic information, so do whatever you can to make it happen. Pretend to be a character the Demon would want to kill, such as a Flowergirl or a Savant, or stay silent. Unlike the Ravenkeeper, who benefits more so when the Demon attacks them later in the game, you benefit most when the Demon attacks you earlier in the game. If the Demon attacks you on the first or second night (or in the first half of the game), then you will have enough days left to execute both suspects you learn might be the Demon.",
    "Reveal your information immediately if the Demon does kill you. The sooner the good team knows that you are the Sage, and that you know 1 of two players is the Demon, then the sooner you can figure out who the Demon is. If you wait until the final day to reveal your information (in the way that a Fortune Teller might wait until the final day to reveal that 1 or 2 still-living players are not the Demon), then you may still only know that the Demon is 1 of 2 players. Also, in this case, you will have to convince the good team that you are the Sage, and you may not have enough time left to do so.",
    "You can simply come out publicly as the Sage, in order to survive until the final day. If you believe that the group trusts you, telling the group that you are the Sage can be a great way to get the Demon to leave you alone, so that other players are killed at night, and other players are executed during the day. Having other players believe that you are good is crucial for this strategy to work. Surviving until the final day means that evil can not automatically win by having all 3 players alive be evil, and it also means that the good team is choosing between 2 players to execute, not 3.",
    "If you die at night but didn't get any information, this is also great news! While you didn't get to find out who the Demon is, you know that the only way you can die at night but not be killed by the Demon is if you were killed by the Pit-Hag's arbitrary deaths, so you can confirm that to town.",
    "If you are the Sage, it's usually a good idea to stay quiet or even pretend that you are some other role. If you pretend to be a role that continuously gains information such as the Fortune Teller or Empath, then the demon is more likely to kill you because they think you are continuing to gain information each night. However, if you tell the town that you are the Sage before you die, the demon is very unlikely to kill you because they know that you would gain very useful information if you are killed by the demon."

  "bluffing_tips": [
    "The power of the Sage only becomes relevant on death, and is incredibly powerful. If you intend to follow a Sage bluff through to completion, you should be prepared to die. It's worth it - if the good team believes you, they'll spend two days executing the people you accuse, instead of your demon! This can be especially effective if you are a Fang Gu (who may die unexpectedly by hitting an Outsider) or if a Pit-Hag is getting up to no good, causing random evil deaths.",
    "As an evil player, you probably want to stay alive for as long as possible to wreak maximum havoc. This can make a Sage bluff more tricky, since you'll have no 'information' to back up your claim without a death at night - but you can turn your survival into a weapon just like your death. Talk to a player early on (someone you know is good - especially potent if they're a powerful character claim like the Savant or Flowergirl), and admit to being the Sage. Later, when the town is suspect of you, tell them you revealed your identity to exactly one person, and accuse them of either being the demon and avoiding killing you, or feeding the demon information about your role!",
    "If you're bluffing as an information role and people are starting to notice that your information is not adding up, consider dropping that bluff and coming out as the Sage instead. Your confusing information will be revealed as not true, but the good team will hopefully think you were only lying for a good cause (to get the demon's attention), and leave you alone."
